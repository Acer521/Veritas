Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is one of the ‘third wave’ cognitive and behavioral therapies. It incorporates acceptance and mindfulness strategies alongside change strategies, in recognition that change is not always possible or desirable. It can do a help with one’s anxiety, depression, and other psychological struggles, with the goal of enabling a person to live in the present and engage in the world around them, living the life they value. 

Before we go with techniques, we must first list a few principles. 

First…

# Negative Thoughts Are No Problem Unless You Fuse With Them
We’ve heard that negative thoughts are bad, problematic, or self-defeating. Winners think positively, losers negatively. ACT, however, thinks of it differently. To ACT, negative thoughts are not inherently problematic. It is only problematic, if we get caught on in them, if we give it attention, if we treat it as gospel, if it is allowed to control us, if we fight it—something we will call “**Fusion**” as we metaphorically and needlessly *fuse* ourselves with our thoughts. Fusion is the act of giving thoughts attention, treating them as truth, allowing them to influence us, or even challenging them with evidence or mental persuasion. It only makes you struggle or avoid the emotion through distraction or inaction. 

## Examples of Thoughts To Hook You
Are these thoughts familiar? ‘I’ve got no motivation’, ‘I’ve got no discipline’, ‘I’ve got no willpower’, ‘I’m too busy’, ‘I’m too tired’, ‘I don’t have time’, ‘I don’t have the energy’, ‘I’ll start next week’, ‘I’ll fail’, ‘It’s a waste of time’, ‘I’ll make a fool of myself’, ‘I don’t have what it takes’, ‘I’m not ready’, ‘It’s too hard’, ‘I need more practice’, ‘I need to read some more books about it’, ‘I need more equipment’, ‘Other people don’t have to go through this’, ‘It shouldn’t be this difficult’, ‘I’m too anxious’ and ‘Every time I’ve tried to change I’ve always failed so why should it be any different this time?’

> “Our minds are like reason-giving machines; as soon as we think about making important changes, they crank out a whole list of reasons why we can’t do it, shouldn’t do it, or shouldn’t have to do it. And there is no way to stop our minds from doing this.” 
> — Russ Harris

There are many different categories of our minds giving out bullshit reasons, but here are the four most common:
- **Obstacles:** Our minds point out all those obstacles and difficulties that lie in our paths.
    - *Counter:* ‘Yes, I am very busy. So to make time to practise my presentation skills, I’ll cut back on the amount of TV I watch’
- **Self-judgements:** Our minds tell us all those ways in which we we’re not up to the task.
    - *Counter:* I’m not good at X, and would like to improve. No point generalizing. I just need to find ways how.
- **Comparisons:** Our minds compare us unfavourably to others who seem to do it better, have more talent, or have it easier.
	- *Counter:* Use it to improve, not to drown in self-pity. ‘What are his strategies? His practices? His Habits? How can I emulate?’
- Predictions: Our minds predict failure, rejection or other unpleasant outcomes.
    - *Counter:* DO NOT LISTEN, YOU DO NOT KNOW THE FUTURE.

This is what the mind gives you you whenever you do something. To get over this, try to change how you view yourself or try to publicly announce it to people whose opinion matters. You should also practice the counters I laid out there until it become second nature.

# Do not blindly listen to your mind
It’s better to trust your writing[^1], then whatever your mind says. Your mind is incoherent and quite literally randomly generating thoughts to hook you[^2]. Your thoughts do not have to control your actions. You can act first, and let the newly generated thoughts catch up. People are so hung up with motivation and having positive thoughts to act first, that they forget they can act first to generate these helpful thoughts.

> [!example]_ Case Study
> Joe Simpson, freezing, agony; right leg shattered, climbing partner ditched him in a crevasse. No food, water, or fire. Stranded in Peruvian Andes. Partner thought he was dead, left for base camp. Against odds, Joe crawled out, mangled leg, three days to base camp, six miles away. Throughout, negative thoughts bombarded Joe. No positive vibes, just the belief he'd die. But he kept going, inch by inch, despite his mind screaming it was futile. Action overcame doubt.

Negative thoughts don't have to hold us back. Joe's story screams it. No need to wait for positivity. 

Take action even when the mind screams "can't." Try it: say "I can't lift my arm" and lift it. Now.

The mind is never always the boss. You can take action first, think later—a lesson we will expand more later.

# Technique for Negative Thoughts: Cognitive Defusion
We have millions of intrusive thoughts a day and they color our view of the world without us noticing. It often spirals to an endless loop of overthinking and self-sabotage. Thoughts are dangerous if we *fuse* into them—the act of giving it attention, treating it as truth, allowing it to control us, or even fighting it with evidence. It only makes you struggle or run.

***Cognitive defusion*** is a skill that reduces the grip of negative emotions by **separating yourself from your thoughts** and observing them objectively before letting them go. Instead of getting hooked by them. Primarily, it enables you to *be present and take effective action*.

> [!info]+ Note
> Defusion is not for ridding thoughts. That’s just a bonus but it’s not th main purpose. If you focus on that, the mind knows and will inject the thought more. The purpose of defusion is this: *to be present and take effective action*. 

### <u>General Steps</u>
1. **Notice It**: Pause for a second, notice what the thought is doing.
2. **Name It**: Label the thought as “just a thought” and not a reflection of reality. A good method is to list or identify these thoughts, then saying, verbatim, “***I notice that I’m having the thought that…***” which effectively distances yourself from it. 
	- Humor is really effective here, You can simply go “Here’s anxiety” or “Judging again” or “Wow, thanks mind, really helpful.” or “Ah, the idiot’s broadcasting again.” or “Ah, this random AI generator again.” or “Look at the excuse-giving machine.” — anything to ridicule and dismiss the random thought generator in your head.
3. **Neutralize it**: Use defuse tactics. You can visualize the thought as a leaf, flowing from a river away from you, or any object you destroy or you let go past you like a cloud. You can give it a name and you can make fun of it. You can be exasperated with it. You can thank it sarcastically or like you’re thanking a child. “Oh wow, a story about how I’m a failure again, thanks so much mind, really helpful.” You can dismiss it as a random generator after naming it—*anything to distance yourself from it and anything to just let it be*, like in meditation. 

These steps maybe simple, but they require a lot of practice. If you want to have better mental health and confidence, practice this well. There are times where you won’t even notice that you are hooked. But practicing makes this easy, being mindful makes this easy. Just notice it, acknowledge it, and silently tell yourself that you got hooked. Just defuse it with one of the many neutralizing techniques and go back to what you should be doing. Practice, do this everytime you have an unhelpful thought.

> [!quote]+
> “When we fuse with our thoughts, they have a huge impact on and influence over us. But when we ‘defuse’ from our thoughts – when we separate from them and realise that they are nothing more or less than words and pictures – then they have little or no effect on us (even if they happen to be true).”
> — Russ Harris
# True or False Doesn’t Matter—Is the thought HELPFUL or not?
It doesn’t matter if a thought is true or false. Ask instead: “**Is it workable or helpful?**”

Is it helping you create a richer, fuller, more meaningful life that you want? 

 Categorizing thoughts between **workable** and **unworkable** helps you defuse from thoughts, empower yourself, and give you a healthier way to deal with thoughts. All you need to do is pause, check in, notice what your mind is saying, and ask the question above. Then determine if you should *defuse* it or not.
 
 It matters not if the thought is true or not—do not debate that. Otherwise, you might believe an unhelpful belief, which makes you act towards that direction. The question we’re interested in is: *“If I let this thought dictate my actions, will it help me to lead the life I want*?”

# What About Feelings? What About Fear?
Does feelings of fear and anxiety truly hinder you? Does feelings truly have that much of an impact? Are we but puppets of our limbic system?

It is a common belief that fear impairs performance—but that’s not the case at all. Woolever and Rich (1988) and others say that it’s expecting to fail and **fusing with negative thoughts** instead of focusing on the tasks at hand, regardless of anxiety levels, that fail students/performers. So, it is not the anxiety itself, but the interaction with it that’s the problem.

Fear is often misunderstood. It's wrongly seen as a sign of weakness when, in reality, stepping out of comfort zones and facing challenges naturally triggers fear—it's a normal human response, not a weakness. Even confident individuals and top performers experience fear; true confidence isn't fearlessness but rather a skill in managing fear without letting it erode confidence. *Ultimately, genuine confidence isn't the absence of fear but a transformed relationship with it*.

From a young age, we’ve been taught that fear is bad, a sign of weakness, that it’s unnatural and holds us back. We learn then to fear our own fear, anxious of our anxiety. A vicious cycle. In autopilot mode, we are at the mercy of our emotions, following it. In avoidance mode[^4], we are getting rid or running away from unpleasant feelings, opting out or distracting ourselves. This isn’t bad until it becomes habitual and ruins your life.

> [!quote]- Get back on the horse
> “Have you ever heard the saying, ‘Get back on the horse’? Personally, I’ve never fallen from a horse, but I’ve been told it is pretty scary. Immediately after a big fall, most people would have some fear of getting back on – especially if they were injured when they fell. But the sooner you get back on and start riding again, the sooner you will regain your confidence. What happens if you don’t remount the horse; if you put it off, week after week, saying, ‘I’ll start again, next week’? The longer you put off riding, the greater your fear grows. If you want to get back into horse-riding, then you have to face your fear; you have to ‘get back on the horse.”
> — Russ Harris

**Feelings and emotions can hinder you, but only if you fuse with them**. Feeling themselves are not inherently bad. Ray Winstone, an actor, got used to flies on his face eventually, despite being bothered by them initially, says it is “like feathers”. Which is an incredible shift. This is what we should do to our feelings. Instead of trying to make it go away, we non-judgmentally notice the sensation. This is important as trying to get rid of feelings take energy and distracts you, it also makes it worse in the long-run. What you should do is **accept, allow, and expand what you can** feel, so that you can be present and engage with the world.

**Thoughts** play a big role in maintaining or exacerbating fears, but we can deal with it using cognitive **defusion**. However, **feelings** are different. First, fear is not always bad. One can harness its energy to one’s advantage: **Convert Anxiety to Excitement**. But, most importantly, fear cannot be dismissed easily—if we distract ourseles or repress it, it gets worse—it must first be accepted. To do that, you must use the technique: **Emotional Expansion**. 

# Emotional Expansion
**Emotional Expansion** is the *opposite of avoidance*. Instead of ridding of it, *you accept it*. Make room for emotions and allow them to come and go in their own pace. It doesn’t mean we like them, want them, or approve them, we just don’t want to waste time and effort fighting them. The more space we give them, the less they can influence our lives.

> [!tip] A Wise Hindu Tale To Drive The Point Home
> There’s an ancient Indian tale that illustrates this point very well. An old Hindu master was fed up with the continual complaints and grumbles of his apprentice. So one day, he asked the young man to fetch him a cup of water and a bowl of salt. When the young man returned, the master said, ‘Now tip a handful of salt into the water.’ The apprentice did so. The master then swirled the water around in the cup until all the salt had dissolved. ‘Now taste it,’ he said to the apprentice. The apprentice took a sip and screwed up his face in disgust. ‘How does it taste?’ asked the master.
> 
> ‘Horrible,’ said the apprentice.
> 
> The master chuckled. ‘Yes, very unpleasant,’ he said. ‘Now follow me.’ They walked down to the edge of a nearby lake, and the master said, ‘Now tip a handful of salt into the lake.’ The apprentice did so.
> 
> The master said, ‘Now taste the water from the lake.’ The apprentice drank from the lake, and this time he smiled. ‘Not so hard to swallow, eh?’ said the master. ‘This salt is like the inevitable pain of life. In both cases, the amount of salt is the same; but the smaller the container, the greater the bitterness. So when life gives us pain, instead of closing in around it, like this cup, we would do better to enlarge and open, like the lake.’

### Remember to Use NAME for Expansion
> N – Notice
> A – Acknowledge
> M – Make space
> E – Expand awareness

This is an acronym for doing emotional expansion quickly. 

First step, you **notice** what you’re feeling. If it’s a physical sensation, mindfully zoom into that. Is it on your neck? Your gut? Find where it starts and ends, seek how it feels. Be curious. And if your mind says it hate the feeling, defuse it.

Then, you **acknowledge** it. “Here’s fear”—do not use first person, objectify it, keep it away from you. We are not our feelings. Do this all non-judgmentally. Remind yourself, “This is a normal feeling. This is what people feel when they face a challenge.”

Then, we **make room**. Here, we “breath into” the feeling, psychologically ‘open up’ or ‘make room’ for it. When we breath deeply, it helps us anchor to the present and when we ‘direct’ our breath into and around the feeling, it helps us drop the struggle with it. The fear is still present, but the more space we give it, the more we expand what we can accept to feel, the less impact it has. Remind yourself constantly that it’s fine, you don’t need to approve of it, it can visit, come and go anytime it wants. Just make enough space to focus on the present.
- Breathe in, breathe out, completely emptying your lungs. Then as you breathe in, direct it into and around the feeling. (Interpret this instruction any way. Basically, in some way, sense or imagine your breath flowing into and around the feeling. Expand the space within you.)
- Remember to keep the sensations under the spotlight, observe them curiously. Little by little, create more space around it. No judgements.
- A tactic is to say to yourself “Opening Up,” “Making Room,” or “Let it be.” Could also be longer like “I don’t like it or want it, but I can make room for it.”
- Another tactic is to gently place your hand over the sensations and notice the warmth flowing from your hand into your body. See if you can ‘soften up’ or ‘loosen up’ around the feeling

Finally, we **expand awareness** to the present and re-engage with the world around us. Move, stretch, do anything to ground yourself—and notice the world around you, be aware of everything all at once.

### Trouble Shooting
It will be difficult, it requires practice, constantly. Moreover people often misunderstand this. Here are some pitfalls to be aware of.

a) **Hidden Agenda:** Expansion aims to create space for difficult feelings, not eliminate them. If you practice expansion hoping to get rid of fear, you're still in avoidance mode. Attempting to eliminate fear will only intensify it.

b) **Illusion of Control:** Occasionally, fear may rapidly disappear during the exercise, leading to a sense of relief. Avoid the trap of thinking you've cleverly controlled your feelings. Using expansion as a method to avoid fear puts you back into avoidance mode. Enjoy any reduction in fear, but don't come to expect it; treat it as a fortunate bonus to prevent future disappointment.

c) **Getting Hooked:** Unhelpful thoughts may arise, such as 'I can't do it' or 'It's too hard.' Let these thoughts come and go like passing cars. Defusion helps manage such thoughts. If persistent thoughts interfere with expansion, additional work on defusion skills is needed.

d) **Tolerance:** Some misconceive expansion as merely tolerating fear—grinning and bearing it or resigning themselves to it. In reality, expansion aims for something different: allowing fear. This doesn't imply liking or wanting fear; it means giving it space to exist without interference. [^3]

e) **Forgetting the Point:** It's easy to lose sight of the purpose of expansion: making room for difficult feelings to align with our values. Living a rich and fulfilling life often involves stepping out of comfort zones, triggering fear each time. Expansion allows us to embrace that fear without struggle, directing our energy toward actions that align with our values.

# Engage with the World
Being present is a wonderful thing. Your sensations become sharper, and you’ll feel stillness and peace. This is often helped by mindfulness. It’s good because you enjoy life more because of it, and everything becomes meaningful. Being fully engaged in a task is also meditative and can activate flow, supercharging performance. Not to mention, in social situations, you’ll appear more confident, thoughtful, and yourself. The goal is to completely focus on what you’re doing.

When we say that someone looks confident, we have no idea what they are thinking or feeling. But we can observe what they are doing; how they are behaving. And one thing you’ll always notice about confident people: they are very engaged in whatever they are doing. When they’re socialising, they’re thoroughly absorbed in the conversation. Remember: *Confident actions first; feelings of confidence later*.

When *fusing with thoughts*, you miss out on the world. However, when you defuse, the world comes into focus, and you could see more clearly and ‘take it all in.’ To get most out of life, you must be fully present: aware, attentive, and engaged.

### The Power of Engangement
You want to have great sex, or a great conversation, or a great game of golf; if you want to write well, sing well, run well; if you want to speak well, negotiate well or compete well, then you have to be psychologically present. You need to be engaged in what is happening.

Suppose you’re playing tennis, and instead of keeping your attention on the ball, you focus on all the thoughts inside your head: ‘Am I holding the racket correctly?’, ‘Are my feet in the best position?’, ‘Wow, that ball’s coming so fast.’ If your focus is on your thoughts rather than the ball, then what quality of game are you likely to play? Chances are, not very good. If you want to play well, you need to keep your attention on the ball.

When you’re in the heat of that important interview, sitting in front of the panel, you need to be engaged with the interviewers. You need to be ‘tuned in’ to what they are saying and how they’re reacting. So the more attention you give to that commentary inside your head – ‘D’oh! I shouldn’t have said that’, ‘Oops, that didn’t come out the way I wanted’, ‘Is this what they really want to hear?’, ‘Uh-oh, I don’t like the expression on her face’ – the harder you’ll find it to focus, and the worse you’ll perform.

### How to Engage
So how do we engage in our experiences? Simple. **We pay attention**. We notice what is happening, here and now. Paying attention is at the very core of mindfulness. But it’s not just paying attention in any old way. Mindfulness means paying attention with openness, curiosity and flexibility. Let’s break that down.
- **Paying attention:** we pay attention to what is happening in this moment, in both our ‘inner world’ and the world outside us. In other words, we notice what we’re thinking and feeling, and also what we can see, hear, touch, taste and smell.
- **Openness:** we are open to what is happening, even if we don’t like or approve of it, as opposed to turning away or closing off from our experiences.
- **Curiosity:** we are curious about what is happening. We actively seek to discover something new in our experience; something we may have missed, or taken for granted. Like an intrepid explorer or an enthusiastic scientist, we pay attention to the details, taking nothing for granted, interested in whatever we may find.
- **Flexibility:** we are flexible in the way we pay attention. At times we may have a narrow focus, such as when we are absorbed in a task: threading a needle, drilling a hole or hitting a golf ball. At other times we may have a broad focus, such as when we are exploring a new city and taking in all the novel sights, smells and sounds. At times we may be more focused on the inner world of our thoughts and feelings. And at other times we may focus more on the external world.

# Footnotes

[^1]: This is why Journaling is very effective. Writing thoughts externalizes it. You’re not fused with it. You see it as it is, a thought you had on a page or computer screen. You can judge it and plan for it.
[^2]: The Default Mode Network attracted a great deal of attention because of its importance in generating self-referential thoughts, negative ruminations, and depressive symptoms. It’s the voice in our heads that doesn’t shut the hell up and is definitely one of the reasons for our anxieties and depressions.
[^3]: To illustrate, envision an 'avoidance dial' in your mind, ranging from zero to ten. At ten, you're in total avoidance mode, doing everything to eliminate the feeling. At zero, you neither like nor want the feeling, but you invest no effort in getting rid of it, which we call 'acceptance.' Tolerance, around five, implies you're moving towards acceptance but haven't fully arrived. Recognize that tolerating is a good start, but there's more practice needed. 
[^4]: Experiential avoidance means trying hard to avoid or get rid of unwanted thoughts and feelings. Now, we are all experientially avoidant to some degree. I don’t know anyone who loves having unpleasant thoughts and feelings, and never tries to avoid or get rid of them. But the more unwilling we are to make room for discomfort, the lower our quality of life. Indeed, high levels of experiential avoidance directly correlate with reduced performance, increased stress and higher risk of depression and anxiety.
