Fear is one of those things that consumes us and cripples us from following through what we really want in life. It forces us in our comfort zones and it kills all potential we could have. But there is actually a really cool method in overcoming fear. I learned this from Tim Ferris, a technique called fear-setting, which I have personally used to talk to anyone or do anything outside my comfort zone.

<b><u>The steps are simple:</b></u>
1. Define your fear 
2. List how you can prevent the worst-case scenario
3. List ways you can repair any damage
4. Name the benefits of an attempt or partial success
5. Describe the cost of your inaction.

Practice this. Mentally, ask yourself: What would I do if I wasn’t *afraid*? How do I *prevent and repair* the worst case scenario? What’s the benefits of my *partial success or attempt*? What’s the cost of inaction?

Remind yourself that you can quite literally prevent it. And, if not, that you can repair it with a few steps. Your mind catastrophizes the smallest things, but it is never accurate. So, think of repair beforehand and think about that. Trust me, the solution is often pretty simple, like a quick conversation.

Then, remind yourself of the benefits of an attempt or a partial success. If that conversation went poorly, know that you are strengthening yourself against rejection. Know that you are making putting yourself out there as a genuine habit. Know that you are becoming the person you want to be with each step. 

And, finally, remind yourself of the cost of inaction. Just think about what your life will look like in the future if you keep staying in your comfort zone, how horrible, how absolutely painful it must be. Focus on that and use it as fuel.

Run through the five steps and practice it until you can do the process in mere seconds. And every time you do this in your mind or in your journal, you count to 5, and then **do it**.
