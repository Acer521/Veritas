# Welcome to Veritas
I love reading and I love notetaking. I loved them for years, since I was a child. This vault is the born from this passion of mine. A collection of notes from all kinds of fields, ranging from political science, psychology, learning, education, sociology, law, philosophy, theology, history, and many more, especially from fields of practical application and wisdom. I’ve taken notes for myself for all these years and I have benefitted from them in ways you could not imagine. It’s not an exaggeration to say that I owe my life to these notes. So, just as it had helped me, I wish it would help you. Welcome to Veritas. Happy reading.

> Publishing would not be as fast as I would’ve liked. I can publish all of my notes, a combined total of three million words, but I found that absolutely unreadable when I did that in Github. As such, I shall try my utmost to rewrite each note, while retaining what I find important in each of them, so that you dear readers can read them with ease. Thank you for understanding.
