| CATEGORY | NOTES |
| ---- | ---- |
| Helieus | → A house riddled with poverty because the Knights Order has power over the original ruling Lords. The same order Karvon and Lilith essentially toppled, along with the entire noble family, leading Helieus to become a house no longer. |
| Hathsin | → Ruled by Kelsier Hathsin, this is the house that replaced House Helieus, as soon as Kelsier took control of the rest of the military using his underground connections. It is not loyal to Prismaran doctrine and is an anomaly, being a noble house without roots. A new player, a wild card to the already tumultuous political game. |
| Silvercrest | → A Civil War by Alice and Hatter Silvercrest. Hatter wanted to unite through mind control (non-violence edicts) while Alice values freedom. At the height of the conflict, Gregor, some random rogue, just double killed Hatter and his first mate, essentially giving the House to Alice. However, the day she was about to assume position, the ground split in two, splitting Silvercrest once more—this time physically. This has vast implications on the political landscape of Prismara. |
| Windchaser | → A House that stole Gregor’s son.<br>→ A House with a Lord that Full-Counters anything that hits him. |
| Ashenvale | → One suspect for stealing Ironrose’s barrier gem.<br><br>→ A House that may have connections to T̴͇̞͍̱͌̚h̴̥͗͛͊̚e̷̡͇͓͝ ̴̩͔̝͙̃͒͌B̶̪͖̓a̵̡̪͈̳͘ŕ̸̟̼̠̈́͜͠d̴͖̱̫̂̋̒ |
| Ironrose | → Has an Isekai Protagonist for a Prince with the sword to atomize anyone in one shot, and a harem to cheer his every good (or bad) decisions.<br>→ Was attacking by an army of something. Ironrose dealt with it with one strike. |
| Serenity | → Weird. I wonder why this got orbital striked. |
| Nexus | → Weird, I wonder why this got orbital striked thrice?<br>→ Lilith lived here before her family got murdered by Kireri. |
| Mythweaver | → There’s a Ball here.<br>→ One suspect for stealing Ironrose’s barrier gem.<br>→ Kirei Mythweaver, Karvon’s body, lived here. |
| Prismara | → The House that saved every other houses by providing them a barrier gem to protect them from the “Dark Forces” of the “Escape.”<br>→ This House ruthlessly only allowed those who kneeled to it to get protected, thereby ensuring its power over all houses, as not only did it get their loyalty, it also has access to the magic that enables or disables the barrier.<br>→ Till this day, they are the royal family. |
| Astral Well | → Karvon came here. Something about Erathis, the Law Bearer—but guy just went to the portal and peaced out before any much needed exposition. |
| Wishing Star | → It apparently grants any wishes, leading everyone to pursue it.<br>→ The Underground and the Knight Order believes it’s in the Astral Well. |
