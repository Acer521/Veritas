Clothing is not merely a superficial layer; it is the armor that shapes perception, the subtle force that dictates how others see you. It has the power to elevate one’s influence and appeal, marking the wearer with an unmistakable aura of authority or elegance. As my father wisely observed, this influence must be paired with a mastery of body language, for the full impact comes when both are perfected. Yet, let no one underestimate the profound role of attire—it is, indeed, a defining element of one’s presence. Clothing does not simply cover the body; it makes the man.

> “Many straight guys are averse to exploring their style and how they dress because they think it’s “gay” or intrudes on their masculinity. It makes most men feel uncomfortable. A lot of men feel set in their ways and don’t like the idea of changing the type of shirts they wear, or the haircut they’ve sported for years and years. They're also intimidated at the idea of standing out or looking too different from the people they hang around. If this describes you, then it is going to be a mental hurdle that you’ll have to overcome. Recognize that unless you’ve spent a large amount of time focusing on fashion and style already, chances are what you think looks good right now is not accurate at all. ”

# FRANCO’s CRASH COURSE ON FASHION
Franco has been a long-time friend, with a deep understanding of fashion theory. Joli Mae, in contrast, brings a clear sense of examples, inspirations, and a strong vision. By consulting them and asking for their help in styling me, I’ve gathered their knowledge into one concise guide on how to dress for style and influence.

### Must Have Items and Combinations
- **Versatile Colors**: Pair chinos in khaki or black with a simple coat in brown, black, or dark blue for a versatile look. Add a color-coordinated brown belt for a polished touch. ✔
- **Jewelry and Accessories**: Choose silver pieces to complement your style, including a silver watch, bracelet, choker necklace, and a bangle. They create the illusion of a whole set, making you less dull. ✔
- **Plain T-Shirts**. These serve as inners. Best ones to get are white, black, cream, khaki, brown. ✔
- **Coats**: Simple coats in brown, black, or dark blue. Other must haves. ✔
- **Polo**: Minimal design. These can be layered on plain inners like coats. It offers quite the versatility. ✔
- **Belts**: Brown belt for contrast. A must have. ❗
- **Chinos**: Colors: Khaki and black. 
- **White Loose Pants**: Casual pair with any T’s and formal pair with blazer pairs. 
- **Black Pants**: Pair with brown or lighter-colored shoes. ✔
- **Khaki Pants**: Wear with black leather shoes; avoid black rubber shoes at all cost.✔
- **Shoes**: Light-colored shoes should be rubber. Black shoes should be leather. ✔
- **Stretchable top**: Colors: white and black. This can be paired with any pants.  ❗
- **Blazers** This pairs well with almost everything. It's versatile and can be dressed formally or informally. Get the colors  navy, black, grey, black, and brown. ❓

### Color and Style Guidelines
- **Opt for Solid Colors**: "Solid colors" refer to fabrics dyed in a single, consistent color without any patterns, prints, or textures. They give you that endless versatility, timeless style, and that effortless polish. 
- **Color Matching**:
    - Avoid fully monochromatic outfits. Use *light or dark contrasts*, or incorporate a *combination of three* colors.
    - Though whites and blacks come in various shades, providing subtle variations and contrasts for light and dark.
    - Inner (Top) vs. Outer (Layer):
        - If wearing lighter shorts and inner layer, choose a black outer layer.
        - For black pants and a white/black inner, pair with a lighter outer layer.
    - Some khakis may have a darker, almost reddish tone. It can pair well with lighter khaki. Dark and light.
        - When pairing khaki with a brown polo shirt, the outfit works due to the contrasting lighter shade of khaki.
        - Khaki can work well with most things. But it needs to be a combination of all three: dark, light, and khaki.
        - If there’s no three-way combination, you can do white or black as a pair but NEVER another khaki.
    - If wearing khaki pants, balance with darker or lighter colors:
        - No Jacket: Pair with a darker inner layer. (to contrast the khaki)
        - With Jacket: Opt for a lighter inner layer. (to balance the khaki)
- **Inner and Outer Layer Coordination**:
    - **Tucking Guide for Shorts**:
        - Tuck out if loose.
        - Tuck in if not loose.
        - Achieve a V-shape by tucking more in the back than the front.
- **Jewelry and Accessories**:
    - Silver jewelry (bracelet, choker, necklace) complements well. (Remember: only inner)
    - A single necklace achieves the illusion of a V-shaped body more than what you think. It’s an extreme boost.
    - Silver choker for polo shirts or something tight on the neck.
    - Bangles can add detail but keep it simple to avoid visual noise on camera.
- **Statement Piece Rule**: A bit unsafe. Let one standout item shine, like a bold jacket or inner, and keep the rest simple.

### What Not To Do
- **Avoid Overly Matching Colors**. Wearing the exact same shade from head to toe can look monotone; mix tones within the same color family for depth.
- **Avoid Clashing Colors**. Too many bright or conflicting colors can be distracting; stick to complementary or analogous colors.
- **Avoid Overly Matching Colors**. Wearing the exact same shade from head to toe can look monotone; mix tones within the same color family for depth. So, don’t go all-white. Don’t go all black, unless there’s a subtle design that makes it pop.  Mix the tones. 
- **Avoid Too Many Statement Pieces**. Multiple bold pieces can compete for attention; let one standout item shine.
- **‘Designs/logos’ are a no-go**. Don’t thrift clothes with damages, even if it’s minimal. There’s always another option.
- **Avoid Over-Accessorizing**. Stick to a few complementary items
- **Don’t Forget About Proportion**—Avoid wearing baggy pieces from head to toe; balance proportions by mixing fitted and oversized items.
- **Avoid Ignoring Maintenance**. Keep pieces in good condition; frayed, pilled, or stained clothes can diminish your look.
- **Don’t Wear Dirty Shoes**. Clean, polished shoes are essential; scuffed or dirty shoes can ruin an otherwise great outfit.
- **Shorts should be a bit above the knee***. Only uncles wear it below nowadays.
