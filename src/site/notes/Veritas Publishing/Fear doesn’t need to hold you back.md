Fear is often misunderstood. It's wrongly seen as a sign of weakness when, in reality, stepping out of comfort zones and facing challenges naturally triggers fear—it's a normal human response, not a weakness. Even confident individuals experience fear; true confidence isn't fearlessness but rather a skill in managing fear without letting it erode confidence. Ultimately, **genuine confidence isn't the absence of fear but a transformed relationship with it**.

## Fear Myths
- **Myth: Fear is a sign of weakness** – Stepping out of the comfort zone, taking risks, or facing challenges induces fear. It's a natural state for normal human beings; not a sign of weakness.
- **Myth: Fear impairs performance** – Top performers, athletes, actors, speakers, musicians face a risk when in the public arena. The fight-or-flight response is a natural reaction to a challenging situation. [[Convert Anxiety to Excitement\|Converting anxiety to excitement]] and labeling it as 'being pumped' or having an adrenaline rush shows the truth: Fear is a potent source of energy, not a liability.
- **Myth: Fear holds you back** – Fear doesn't hold you back; it's your attitude towards it that matters. Holding onto the belief that fear is 'bad' and prevents you from achieving leads to being stuck. Attitude plays a role in common anxiety disorders; accepting fear is crucial for overcoming it.
- **Myth: Confidence is the absence of fear** – Confident people also experience fear in challenging situations. The key is knowing how to handle fear effectively without letting it destroy confidence.

Because here’s the truth: **Genuine confidence is not the absence of fear; it is a transformed relationship with fear**.

“You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. The danger lies in refusing to face the fear, in not daring to come to grips with it.”
— Eleanor Roosevelt

## The Fear Trap and The Solution
From a young age, we’ve been taught that fear is bad, a sign of weakness, that it’s unnatural and holds us back. We learn then to fear our own fear, anxious of our anxiety. A vicious cycle. In autopilot mode, we are at the mercy of our emotions, following it. In avoidance mode, we are getting rid or running away from unpleasant feelings, opting out or distracting ourselves. This isn’t bad until it becomes habitual and ruins your life.

**Thoughts** play a big role in maintaining or exacerbating fears, which can be dealt with using [[Cognitive defusion\|cognitive defusion]]. But, **feelings** are different. This one can be dealt with [[Emotional Expansion\|Emotional Expansion]]. However, fear is not always bad. One can harness its energy to one’s advantage: [[Convert Anxiety to Excitement\|Convert Anxiety to Excitement]].

> [!quote]- Get back on the horse
> “Have you ever heard the saying, ‘Get back on the horse’? Personally, I’ve never fallen from a horse, but I’ve been told it is pretty scary. Immediately after a big fall, most people would have some fear of getting back on – especially if they were injured when they fell. But the sooner you get back on and start riding again, the sooner you will regain your confidence. What happens if you don’t remount the horse; if you put it off, week after week, saying, ‘I’ll start again, next week’? The longer you put off riding, the greater your fear grows. If you want to get back into horse-riding, then you have to face your fear; you have to ‘get back on the horse.”
