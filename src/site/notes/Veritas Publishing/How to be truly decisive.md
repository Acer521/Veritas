> Thinking hard on decisions, like making pros and cons lists, is not being decisive. It’s expecting others to make the decision for us. We’re postponing. We do this because of our fear of regret, we want to make the “right decision”—but that doesn’t exist. True decisiveness is deciding despite incomplete information, then making it work. 

### Make Wrong Decisions
Most of our fear of regrets is often hinged on inefficiency. We don’t like it because time is limited. Theoretically, people who make fast decisions should be inefficient, living a life full of regret. Is this true though? There are plenty of people making decisions without worry and they’re alright. They just shrug and choose. In fact, a lot of them seem happier and less anxious. A lot of them seems to have less regrets! Why is that? They should be making mistakes most of the time. How is making wrong decisions helpful? 

The answer? **They make each decision, no matter how fast and rash, work for them, making most of the situation or decision regardless of scale**.  

When a decisive person makes a decision, it doesn’t look like a mistake. It’s not because they made the “right” choice, but because of what they did after the choice, which affects the overall outcome[^1]. Outcomes aren’t dictated by the choice but what you do after you make the choice. [^2]

An indecisive person tries to pick the right choice; a decisive person makes the choice they pick work.

### Right decisions comes after the decision not before
As a society, we started to assume that the rightness or the wrongness of an outcome comes from decisions. We began surrendering our ability to shape the outcome. In truth, decision-making should be less about wondering if a decision is good (since you fallaciously placed a truth value on a future that has yet to exist) and more about making that decision work.

Wishing “I hope it will work out for me” will just make you complacent. Mentally checking out after a choice is just laziness. If you mentally check-out after choosing what you think is the “right” girl, that girl will leave you. The wrongness isn’t in the choice, but in what you do after you make a choice.

**Decisions aren’t done after you decide, they’re finished after you get the outcome you want**. You instead should ask “How can I make this work out for me? How can I make most out of this decision?”

### <u>Why You Shouldn’t Overthink Decisions</u>
- Decisions aren’t forever. Many decisions don’t impact you in the long run, many can be repeated, many have insignificant potential losses, many can be reversed or left behind, many can be tested, many can be chosen in parallel with other decisions, and many aren’t permanent.
- Mistakes and inefficiencies are completely normal. There is no way to avoid it. So, accept it and try instead to make every decision work for you so that you make less of it. If you do it enough, you’ll get really good at it.
- The wrongness isn’t in the choice, but in what you do after you make a choice. If you make a perceived mistake, you shouldn’t whine or get traumatized by it. You should work to still get the outcome you need. 
- If you’re open to mistakes—and you should be—that enables you to fully committed. If you’re fully committed, you can change any outcome and learn how to change any outcome, which results to fewer mistakes. 
- If you make the “wrong choice”, it doesn’t matter since you have the capacity to **pivot** or even make **Reversible Decisions**. You can always pivot (which you should fully-commit to). It’s better to be decisive about the choice and about the pivot, then being indecisive about both of them. 
- People who are decisive, who are open to mistakes and inefficiencies, who know the that they can pivot any time, are more happy and have less regrets than people who overthink decisions.

### Get Comfortable With Imperfect Decisions
**Embrace imperfect decisions**. Confident individuals don't necessarily make correct choices; rather, they are willing to accept imperfect outcomes. Progress entails making mistakes and learning from them, and tolerating imperfection can be learned as a **skill**. It’s actually just picking anything and getting really good at being resilient. Going with the flow. Accepting the messiness of it all as being fused with the joy of it. And when you have made a decision- Celebrate your good decisions. Remind yourself of them. **This is how you build self-confidence.**

### A Step-by-step Model
-   **Can you identify what you’re afraid of?** are you afraid that you’ll regret your dinner choice? That you’ll choose the wrong career and be stuck forever? What is your fear? Get super clear on it. Write it down. 
-   **Then ask yourself, if that fear really happened, visualize how you would manage?** If you ate someplace terrible- could you tolerate the regret? If you chose the wrong career, could you try a different one?
-   **Accept that there are no perfect decisions,** making a decision comes with risk. Life comes with risk. Choosing to take no risks in life comes with a high risk of being disappointed and lonely. If you’re afraid to choose a major, you’ll end up working in the only available jobs at your education level. Life will choose for you if you don’t.

<u>Questions to Ask Yourself</u>: What would I do if I wasn’t *afraid*? How do I *prevent and repair* the worst case scenario? What’s the benefits of my *partial success or attempt*? What’s the cost of *inaction*? What’s the *smallest step* I can take forward?

> The idea that thinking hard on decisions and making pros and cons lists is not being decisive, and that true decisiveness is deciding despite incomplete information and then making it work, is supported by research in the field of decision-making.
> 
> Research has shown that people tend to overestimate the importance of making the "right" decision and underestimate the importance of adapting and making the chosen decision work. For example, a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that people who focused on making the best possible decision reported more regret and negative emotions than those who focused on adapting to their chosen decision.

> Similarly, a study published in the Journal of Consumer Research found that people who were given the option to change their minds after making a decision were more satisfied with their choice and less likely to experience regret than those who did not have that option.
> 
> Furthermore, research has shown that fear of regret can lead to decision-making paralysis and indecision. For example, a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that people who were highly sensitive to regret were less likely to make a decision and more likely to experience decision-making paralysis.
> 
> In terms of embracing imperfect decisions and being comfortable with risk and uncertainty, research has shown that people who have a growth mindset (i.e., a belief that their abilities and intelligence can be developed through hard work and dedication) are more likely to embrace challenges, take risks, and learn from their mistakes. This mindset has been linked to greater resilience, perseverance, and success.

[^1]: They can also, and aren’t afraid to, pivot.
[^2]: In DOTA, sometimes your team is doing something stupid. Half of your team is making a stupid play. Sometimes the only choice that you got when your team is making a stupid play is to make it with them. Decisive stupid plays will outperform indecisive good plays. It’s fascinating because good decision-makers find a way to make it work.
