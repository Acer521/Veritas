# How to read System Diagrams
A system is a conglomeration is a collection of things that lack interconnectedness or function, like sands on the road. A system, however, consists of elements, interconnections, and a purpose. Its behavior, however, is different from its elements.

Almost every system tries to ensure its perpetuation. It responds heavily therefore from external damage. Its resilient, able to adapt and survive in a changing environment. It is capable of self-organization, it can learn, evolve, self-regulate, and develop complexity on its own. Self-organization generates Hierarchies of nested systems, systems with subsystems as you go down and systems comprising larger systems as you go up. This gives structure, yielding stability, efficiency, and resilience, as well specialization for each subsystem.

**Stock-and-flow diagram:** A visual representation of a system that shows inflows, outflows, reinforcing and balancing loops, stocks, and interconnections with other systems. [^1]

A **stock**, the box in the picture, is a finite element that’s being accumulated, depleted, or stored over time. (e.g., the population of a city, books in a bookstore, money in a bank).[^2]

Stocks change overtime depending on **flow**. A flow represents elements entering and leaving the stocks. For example, an inflow might represent births (adding to the stock) and an outflow might represent deaths (reduction of the stock). You can increase stocks by increasing inflow and decreasing outflow[^3]. Arrows are also used to represent the flow of influence that is affecting a particular element.

A **feedback loop** is a circle of causal connections that link back to itself. Its reactions affecting itself, and it can either be positive or negative. It’s a mechanism regulating a system’s behavior and it occurs when a system’s output is used as its input or when it *influences* itself.

It also occurs when a change in the stock affects the inflow or outflow of that very same stock. It can work in both directs, inflow or outflow, and can regulate its flow rates. It can, therefore, cause it to grow, decline, or be stable. 

Know, however, that it is <u>everywhere</u>, systems always influence itself. There is always a feedback loop behind every pattern or process.

There are two types of Feedback loops: <u>Balancing and Reinforcing</u>.

![400](https://i.imgur.com/jF2zudP.png)

A **balancing feedback loop** aims to stabilize a stock within a desired goal or range, often represented as a gap or discrepancy. If the goal is to move 60mph, then it will cause you to accelerate to 60, but no faster. They underline goal-related behavior, implicit or explicit. 

In a diagram, Balancing loops are represented as (B) and the goal or desire is represented as the one influencing the gap or discrepancy, which results in actions taken to resolve the gap.

|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

If someone tries to change it, balancing processes are designed to self-correct to maintain some goal or target—its most crucial element. As such, to change it, you must either weaken its influence or alter its goal or target. [^4]

Interestingly, what makes them difficult is that the goals are often implicit and no one recognizes it exists. It’s more difficult to notice because it looks as if nothing is happening. To understand systems, we must understand its goals. So, whenever there’s a resistance to change, there’s high chances that it’s a hidden balancing process.

**Reinforcing feedback loops** are the processes behind growth and accelerated decline. It enhances and amplifies itself. A small change can build on itself. This often leads to exponential growth or collapse. In diagrams, it’s represented as (R).

|:-------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|

However, know that pure accelerating growth or decline rarely occurs in nature, reinforcing processes rarely occur in isolation. Eventually, limits are encountered, which can slow, stop, divert, or reverse it. The limits are often from balancing feedback loops. 

Know that <u>Feedback loops are everywhere</u>. Not recognizing their influence on actions and events, not recognizing the patterns and only acknowledging the events, is the core of our powerlessness in complex situations. We assume that human actors are the center of action, even though we’re also affected by our environment and often hold only one part of the story. In truth, we’re part of the feedback loop.

Many feedback processes contain **delays**, interruptions between actions and their effects, which makes consequences occur gradually. Delays can make one badly overshoot  or undershoot, unless you work with them[^5]. It is common to misjudge them, however, creating instability, especially if they’re long. Adjusting the shower temperature, for instance, is more difficult if there’s a ten second delay before the water temperature adjusts. In diagrams, delays are represented by lines || slashed across the arrows of influence.

Delays in balancing feedback loops result in system oscillations, like in production and delivery overshooting orders. The more aggressive your behavior, the more drastic you turn the shower’s knobs, the longer it will take to reach the right temperature. Aggressive action often produces the opposite of what was intended, producing instability and more oscillation. 

Delays also contribute to reinforcing loops. In a war against terrorism, the delay of a response is perceived by each side as trying to gain advantage. It could take months or years of gathering of resources for the next cycle of attacks. In part, it’s this temporary a perceived advantage that keeps it escalating. If each side responds instantly, incentives to keep building would dwindle.

> [!hint] Dynamic Equillibrium and Shifting Dominance
> ### **Dynamic equilibrium**
> This occurs when the rate of inflows and outflows are balanced, like an open tap and an open sink—its level doesn’t change but the elements continuously flow. The stock here remains unchanged. Here, no feedback loop dominates. 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/FWDf2pD.png)
>  A goal-seeking balancing feedback loop approaches or holds a dynamic equilibrium. A reinforcing feedback loop generates exponential growth. 
> 
> ### **Shifting Dominance**
> When one feedback loop dominates the system, which determines its behavior. This often shifts from one loop to another over time. 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/ICv37jI.png)
> This is because of nonlinear relationships. Their relative strengths shift in disproportionate amounts as the stocks in the system shift. 
> - A delay in a balancing feedback loop makes a system likely to oscillate.
> - Changing the length of a delay may make a large change in the behavior of a system.

> [!abstract] Types of Systems
> ## **One-Stock Systems**
> ### A stock with two competing balancing loops
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/7b35Ss7.png)
> 
> -   <u>One balancing feedback loop regulates the inflow</u>: A desired temperature compared against the real temperature of the system stock. The delta between desired and actual influences the subsequent flow of more heat (or reduced inflow).
> -   <u>One balancing feedback loop regulates the outflow</u>: The outside temperature influences the inside temperature based on the delta between outside temp and inside temp. A higher delta (e.g. between high room temp and low outdoor temp) results in increased outflow of indoor heat.
> -  Because of the competing outflow, the thermostat inflow needs to be set *HIGHER* than the target or desired temperature.
> 
> ### A Stock with One Reinforcing Loop and One Balancing Loop
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/QH4Fic2.png)
> - Inflow is governed by a *reinforcing loop*. As births increase (fertility levels), the population stock increases which drives more births and adds more rapidly to the population stock. Outflow is regulated by a *balancing loop*—mortality rate. 
> - Population grows when the birth rate outpaces the mortality rate. Population declines when the reverse is true. 
> - Remember: fertility and mortality are governed by their own feedback loops (they can be modeled as discrete systems that interconnect with the population system).
> 
> This is similar in an economy. Reinforcing feedback loop: increased capital stock leads to reinvestment and increasing capital over time. Balancing loop: lifetime of the capital affects depreciation. The longer the lifetime, the smaller fraction of capital needs to be retired/replaced annually.
> - ![300](https://i.imgur.com/CRj5NL2.png)
> 
> ### A System with Delays—Business Inventory
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/xD1KMsm.png)
> - Balancing feedback loop regulates the inflow to ensure that there are 10 days of vehicle inventory in stock. 
> - Balancing feedback loop regulates the outflow (customer demand). Dealer can monitor sales and sales trends. If forecast is higher, the dealer can modify the inflow of new vehicles accordingly. 
> 	-   **Delays** are inherent to the system. The response to each balancing loop is not immediate or always accurate.
> 		-   **Perception delay**: The dealer bases their ordering decisions on a 5-day average to smooth the temporary spikes and dips in demand.
> 		-   **Response delay**: The dealer doesn’t adjust inflows in a single order. They make up a fraction of any shortfall with each subsequent order. Changes in inflows occur over several days (rather than as a one-time, immediate response).
> 		- Delays in balancing feedback loops result in system **oscillations** (fluctuations over time of inventory levels).
> 			-  Other delays: production delays, delivery delays, construction delays.
> 			- “Delays are pervasive in systems, and they are strong determinants of behavior. Changing the length of a delay may make a large change in the behavior of a system.”
> 
> ### A Renewable Stock Constrained by a Nonrenewable Stock
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/RVqNbli.png)
> - This model considers environmental constraints (which is lacking in the simpler single stock models). 
> 	-   **Resource-constrained systems**: Inflow supply constraints.
> 	-   **Pollution-constrained systems**: Outflow constraints (production is not feasible because the damage to the environment is too great or hazardous).
> - Constraints on a system can be either **temporary** or **permanent**. 
> - The size of the constraining resource is the key variable in this system.
> 
> ### A Renewable Stock Constrained by a Renewable Stock
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/b7DUJ3n.png)
> -   <u>Living vs. nonliving renewable resources:</u>
> 	-   Nonliving renewable resources: sunlight, wind, water in a river are regenerated through steady input regardless of the state of that stock.
> 	-   Living renewable resources: fish, trees, cattle. These resources can regenerate and regrow. Note that the regeneration rate of these resources are not constant and are constrained by their stock and environment.
> - Renewable resources are flow limited. They can support extraction or harvest indefinitely but only at a finite flow rate equal to their regeneration rate.
> - Some over-extracted renewable resources can be driven below a critical threshold and effectively become nonrenewable (e.g. fish stocks).

> [!example] Mental Models for Systems Thinking
> Mental Models
> 1. <u>Ask yourself</u>: If A causes B, is it possible that B also causes A?
> 2. <u>There always is a Feedback Loop</u> that regulates or reinforces a system’s behavior. 
> 	- <u>If a system is exhibiting growth or accelerated decline</u>, look for a reinforcing loop that drives inflows and a balancing loop that limits it—there are always limits. 
> 	- <u>If something is difficult to change</u>, look for a balancing loop. Try to weaken its influence or alter its goal. Do note that its purpose may be implicit and requires deep investigation. 
> 	- <u>Do not underestimate system delays</u>. They bite back as a side-effect for a short-term fix or they arrive too late to bring a solution. 
> 	- Look for [[System Archetypes\|System Archetypes]] that match what you’re observing. 
> 3. Look for [[Intervening in a system\|leverage points]] to change a system. Changing its elements has the least impact, but changing its behaviors and purpose give fundamental results.
> 4. The human mind seems to focus more easily on stocks than on flows. When we do focus on flows, we tend to focus on _inflows_ more easily than on outflows.[^3]

[^1]: Remember: System diagrams are simplified representations of the real world 
[^2]: Stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in systems. It also allows inflows and outflows to be separated and independent.
[^3]: “A stock takes time to change because flows take time to flow.” – This is important because people underestimate the time needed to change large or complex systems. Also, renewable resources are flow-limited. They can support extraction or harvest indefinitely but only at a finite flow rate equal to their regeneration rate. Some over-extracted renewable resources can be driven below a critical threshold and effectively become nonrenewable (e.g. fish stocks).
[^4]: Goals as desired cash balances change over time as it’s maintained by another system, in this case the businesses and its growth or decline. That means that in complex scenarios, targets often move. Regardless, the balancing process will continue to work to adjust what is needed, even if the target is moving. 
[^5]: Ray Stata, former CEO of Analog Devices and founder of the Massachusetts High Technology Council, wrote that “One of the highest leverage points for improving system performance, is the minimization of system delays.”; The effects of delays are best summarized by the [[Beer Distribution Game\|Beer Distribution Game]].  In the beer game, the delay between placing and receiving orders for beer regularly results in overordering.
