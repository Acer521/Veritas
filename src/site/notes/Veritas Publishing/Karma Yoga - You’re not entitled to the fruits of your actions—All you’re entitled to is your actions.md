**You’re not entitled to the fruits of your actions, all you’re entitled to IS your actions**. You’re not entitled to getting an A, the only thing you’re entitled to is studying. You can study as much as you want, but there’s no true guarantee you’re even passing. Expecting otherwise leads to unneeded suffering.

We think actions control outcomes, but [[Control Fallacies\|it doesn’t]]. You can work towards something, but you can’t guarantee that it will happen. Yet, we become entitled to a particular outcome and we suffer for it. To accept failure and setbacks, one must understand what they’re entitled to and not entitled to. 

The source of suffering comes from a miscalculation of what we’re *owned* in life. So, ask yourself: What was I really owed in this situation? Did I do the best I can? Is it really mine to control whether I succeed or fail? Did I really deserve to succeed?

The more you step away from expectations, the easier it is to accept failure. 

> [!example] Examples and Equivalents
> **Example**: If you have a crush on a girl and you invest so much of your time on them, somewhere along the way, people become entitled to having a relationship with them.<u> Do not expect</u> that she’s entitled to like you back. Regardless of what you sacrifice, only the action is clear, the outcome is not. 
> 
> **Karma Yoga**: One should focus on their actions and not worry about the results of those actions. The idea is that if you do good things, good things will happen to you, but you shouldn’t do good things just because you want good things to happen to you. Instead, you should do good things because it’s the right thing to do.
> 
> **The Stoic equivalent of this idea is called “[[Amor Fati\|Amor Fati]]”,** which means “love of fate”. It is a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of accepting whatever happens to you, whether it’s good or bad. According to Amor Fati, we should focus on what we can control (our own actions) and not worry about what we can’t control (external events).
> 
> **The Buddhist equivalent of this idea is called [[Nekkhamma\|Nekkhamma]]”**. It is a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of letting go of our attachment to things, people, and outcomes. According to Non-Attachment, we should focus on doing our best and not worry about the outcome.

> [!tip] Accepting Failure Through Proper Expectations
> # Accepting Failure Through Proper Expectations
> When you’ve TRULY done everything you can, accepting failure is easy—because you know you did everything. The outcome is now out of your control. If you give it your all and you failed, there’s a bizarre amount of peace with that. 
> 
> If you feel it’s difficult to accept failure, chances are that you need to dig deeper and see if you think you did everything you can or if you think you could’ve done more, but you didn’t.

> If you feel that it’s difficult, understand and practice: [[Veritas Publishing/Karma Yoga - You’re not entitled to the fruits of your actions—All you’re entitled to is your actions\|Karma Yoga]], then [[Veritas Publishing/Vairagya\|Vairagya]]
