In Hindu, “*Vidya*” refers to ignorance about our true selves.. We think we know who we are, but that’s not true, and that causes suffering. In Buddhism, the concept of *Impermanence (Anicca)* marks the idea that all things, physical or mental, are subject to change. Nothing is ever the same. This means that our Sense of Self is also subject to change. As such, *the Doctrine of No-Self* or *Anatta* asserts that there is no consistent self. We change, every time: our cells, memories, connections, and more. **A person from yesterday is not the same person today**.

So, what does this all mean? Why should we care? Well, it means that **YOU DIE EVERYTIME YOU WAKE UP**. There is no consistent you, there never was. This is why in many studies we think of future ourselves as another stranger. This is why we go “I’ll just deal with this in the future” and fail, not accounting time and energy. Because that person we rely on the next day is not us. That is a person with different memories and states of consciousness and mood (literally, our daily dopamine cap is different). You wake up, a different person everyday.

You live in a world where random people wake up, try the game of life for a while, then give it off to the next person.

**You don’t exist beyond today**. This day is what you only have. We spend so much time giving ourselves pleasure because we expect our future selves to clean up the mess, when we’re actually screwing the guys next our run over with their starter stats and starter environment. This is why we screw our lives and cut our consistency.

Now, what would your life look like if we **adopt a mindset where we could only inhabit our body only for a day**? Well, future discounting makes it so that we’re just hedonists. But, if we adopt that mindset with an acceptance and compassion for the people next to us, with an understanding that we’re inheriting this life from those who came before us, with a clarity that we’re custodians of this life for those who come next, then something interesting happens… You become more consistent to who you wish to be and you get to truly live the day as if you are living it as your last.

Life is not a single player game, but a team multi-player, body-swap sandbox game, with a long-term goal aligned with values you’d sacrifice for. When playing this type of game, you don’t screw up the next player, you **PLAY THE BEST GAME YOU CAN** even if you can’t feel the joy of winning, and, then, you give it to the next guy, hoping he performs the same. A form of self-compassion that achieves your goals. To live a life of consistency, paradoxically it’s to realize there’s no consistency. Accept that you are merely a temporary custodian, and that you only have *today* to make a difference…
