> German Sociologist Niklas Luhmann invented the Zettelkasten, allowing him to produce an absurd amount of work in little time while only doing things that he likes doing. If something bores him, he switches tasks—and this system allows him to do so. It’s a way to link, manage, store, and understand ideas. It also happens to be a revolutionary Knowledge Management System that side-steps the disadvantages of disorder and complexity that folders and tags often deal with. It uses unpredictability to its advantage to generate insights and ideas, ensuring that every note has value and is subjected to serendipitous discovery. An anti-fragile knowledge management and note-taking system.
> 
> It facilitates a bottom-to-top approach to note-taking where usability increases with more notes, unlike folders and tags. Every idea, every note, has value and isn’t wasted. This, in my opinion, is the best Personal Knowledge Management System in existence—a powerful tool that only gets stronger with time. As such, it is beneficial to learn it, from bottom-to-top, top-to-bottom.

# Three Types of Notes
Before we talk about the process, it is necessary to first familiarize yourself with the types of notes that you will be dealing with in the Zettelkasten. These are easy enough to understand, and it’ll be automatic once you start using it.

1. **Fleeting Notes** – Fleeting notes are quick, informal notes on any thought or idea that pops into your mind. They don’t need to be highly organized, and, in fact, they shouldn’t be. They are not meant to capture an idea in full detail, but serve more as reminders of what was in your head.
2. **Literature Notes** – Synthesis of observations collected while reading or consuming content. This has most of the author's thoughts, and is used to process permanent notes. Highlight excerpts or any notes of something are considered literature notes.
3. **Permanent Notes** – Permanent notes make up the long-term knowledge that gives the Zettelkasten its value. It must be concept-oriented and it must be densely linked to other permanent notes; the more connections, the stronger the connections, the better. These notes are normally processed from fleeting and literature notes.
4. **Index Notes** – A curated list of links, similar to a table of contents, that pulls permanent notes related to a specific topic and organizes them according to one’s personal categorization of the information. It’s a way to organize information that provides easy navigation and flexibility, as well as highlighting areas of interest.

## Atomic Permanent Notes
How should we structure our permanent notes? On one hand, we have the argument that permanent notes ought to be as small and compact as possible. On the other hand, there’s a camp arguing that it should be as long as it needs to be, with as much weaving of connections as possible. 

Both have lasting merits. Small notes emulate index cards, making it easy to switch between ideas to seek a particular note, connection, or inspiration—permanent notes also works best when they’re atomic. Longer notes, however, enable you to add more details you think are necessary or valuable. I acknowledge both types and see the inherent value within them. But, it is a false dichotomy, a fallacy to assume that we have to pick one over the other.  

**Atomic notes** seek to combine these two approaches while avoiding any disadvantages that could arise from their combination. After all, these ideas are not necessarily contradictory. In fact, they actually complement each other.

In this particular template, we have a summarization of the entire note, in quotations, on top and the elaboration/details below it. Citations and links are, of course, included. Here, we can take the best of both words and combine them without undermining any benefits that could result from over-preference. 

The summarization takes the best parts of the “Small Notes” argument and combines them with the flexibility of the “As Long As It Needs To Be” notes. The summarization synthesizes the essence of the entire note that it can be read quickly, getting the idea in as short amount of time as possible. It gives you the decision-point to switch notes or continue reading the elaboration to know more. This is great for people who want to find certain notes but don’t like scrolling to find that one detail. You get the idea of what the note is trying to say, and that’s almost always what you need, especially if you are searching for certain ideas or inspirations as fast as possible. It also ensures that the permanent notes remain<u> concept oriented</u> and <u>a synthesis of one’s own thoughts</u>. Lastly, it simulates index cards, adding to its navigability and potential serendipitous discovery.

For the people positing that notes should be as long as it needs to be, the added elaboration/details below the summarization will do the trick. This way, you won’t lose the advantages of “small notes”, and you will also extract the benefits of writing details and elaborations for as long as you need it to be. But the best part is that it increases the opportunity to provide more links/connections through the details themselves. In academic concepts, this can be used to provide examples, evidences, proofs, or anything else essential that adds to the value of the note. 

Atomic notes are useful in that you can choose to continue reading to find more information or be satisfied with the summarization. You can add any details necessary while maintaining its atomicity. You get the best of both worlds, without the negatives that come from preferring one or the other.

**However**, one must still remember that a note should only really focus on one concept. The Zettelkasten will not detect details or elaborations directly. If you want a certain detail to be found and not abandoned, you have to make a permanent note of it with many links, not leave it as a footnote or mere extra detail. This is a word of caution for people who go overboard with longer notes.

# How to Take Smart Notes on E-Books
Since people will be very interested on the process itself, I will talk about how it works first, through the e-book to Zettelkasten process, before discussing what the Zettelkasten is capable of and how it can be used to improve your life and career.

# On The Zettelkasten
##### The Zettelkasten is more useful the more it grows
The traditional way of organizing with tags and folders is good—after all, it worked for many decades—but, make no mistake, it’s very fragile. Eventually, it'll become so complicated and varied that finding something would be almost impossible, either because of overabundance or convolutedness.

The Zettelkasten is not a collection, but an interconnected web of ideas. You can find these ideas based on the context you need. Its usability grows with its size exponentially, unlike traditional organization methods. (which is pretty insane)

The Zettelkasten provides a place where batches of work can be worked on, created, and saved permanently, until it is required again. That means you'll never have a truly useless note or project.

It's a “Verbund”, a setup where the by-product on one production line becomes the resource for another until a network become so efficiently intertwined that there's no chance of competing with it anymore. In many ways, it’s also an antifragile system.

##### The Zettelkasten is an Antifragile system
The Zettelkasten is an antifragile note-taking and Personal Knowledge Management System. It’s decentralized and employs a bottom-up approach to notetaking. Its “verbund nature” makes certain that it always increases in value, even if a project is finished. Its linking capabilities ensure that even if one note fails, it won’t hurt the entire system since it’s localized. It also doesn’t hurt personally as much since it doesn’t take as much time and there’s always a backup for literature notes and fleeting notes. 

Hell, the failure can be an advantage since it can always be used as inspiration or for some other notes and **it allows the system to adjust itself**. In other words, it’s constantly improving, especially in the face of unpredictability, disorder, and chaos.

##### Zettelkasten Aiding Objective Reasoning
Ahrens actually wanted to develop a Thinking System, which is what led him to the Zettelkasten. It's a tool that confronts you with opposing facts. This will open you to different perspectives and contradicting facts, making you biases weaker.

##### Zettelkasten is a linking system | The Tragedy of Orphan Notes
<u>Orphan notes</u> are permanent notes without links to other notes. These notes might as well be nonexistent because there will be nothing to refer back to them, but their name. In a growing system like the Zettelkasten, it will surely be wasted effort and time. In a system of thousands of notes, discovering these unlinked idea will take a good memory (which is counterproductive since we use notes to not rely on memory) or coincidence. As such, one must link their notes, should they wish to retain its value in the future.

**Quick Tip:** You should organize your notes by context on when or where it will be discovered in the future. "Where will I want to stumble upon this again” is better than mere topics and subtopics, which will make it seem less complex but will quickly overwhelm you later on.

- ## Using the Zettelkasten
##### Zettelkasten as an idea generator
The brain generates ideas, unconsciously or consciously, through linking ideas together. The Zettelkasten is good for generating ideas because of its numerous connections. You can explore connections from one note to another and see the bigger picture or a perspective you haven’t thought of before. One fact can lead to another fact, perhaps one outside the expected field it’s associated by—resulting to unexpected <u>multidisciplinary connections</u>. 

In this way, combining different fields will be as easy as clicking a few links or running Graph Analysis to see Co-citations. In essays, you can use this to create well-researched pieces that borrow from other disciplines to support your case. In writing, you can use this to see your research or ideas in a different light, gaining insights you wouldn’t otherwise get through googling. Through the Zettelkasten, you can seek ideas, create ideas, and synthesize them to your heart's content, and those ideas become yours and yours alone. 

##### Zettelkasten aids thinking through writing
When we write, we engage with the material. We think through the words and translate them with our own thinking processes and mental representations. This causes us to understand it better. It is also a way that we can think slowly and make connections. It is not separate from thinking, it is thinking.

The challenge of writing is to understand concepts first, as you need to truly understand something in order to write about it. This makes you elaborate and therefore engage a material on a deeper level. 

After all, meaning requires elaboration, and we need an external medium to perform this elaboration efficiently, Fortunately, writing happens to be the most effective and convenient medium ever invented. And, moreover, the Zettelkasten is a good medium to write in, especially since every note has value, and every note has use. 

##### Zettelkasten aids learning
The Zettelkasten forces you to learn by making you elaborate and engage deeply on certain topics. It also uses spaced repetition, as well as variation and randomized context, which aids one’s personal learning and growth. 

<u>There are five ways working with a slip box shapes your habits so you learn better</u>:

1. Elaboration: This is why it’s important not to copy/paste, but to write things in your own words. When you write something in your own words, you have to connect the new knowledge to your existing knowledge. You have to think about its broader implications. Ahrens says elaboration is the most effective technique for learning.
2. Spacing: In managing a slip box, you retrieve information repeatedly, after time away from it. This happens when you review your highlights and fleeting notes to elaborate on them and turn them into permanent notes. This also happens when you retrieve old notes to connect them to new notes. Your memory of information fades away over time, but when you’re repeatedly exposed to information – a phenomenon called “spaced repetition” – you retain it better.
3. Variation: Using a slip box, you review information in a variety of contexts: You read it, you take fleeting notes, you translate those into permanent notes, then you review the information further when retrieving it and linking it to other notes. This variety helps you more robustly link new knowledge to existing knowledge.
4. Contextual Interference: Contextual interference is a randomization of contexts, and it has been shown to improve learning. For example, instead of practicing throwing all day, you might randomly alternate amongst throwing, catching, and running. The very nature of managing a slip box randomizes the contexts in which you interact with information.
5. Deliberate effort: Deliberate practice – where you’re deliberately practicing individual skills, with rapid feedback – is more effective than simply doing whatever you feel like. Managing a slip box is structured and deliberate practice.

##### Automatic Research Using The Zettelkasten
Researching and brainstorming by yourself is difficult and time-consuming. Brainstorming with a group is almost always vulnerable to groupthink. The most efficient way to research and generate ideas is to use the Zettelkasten, where researching is <u>already done for you</u> and brainstorming is just you looking for connections. Everything is already there.

This is the bottom-to-top approach of note-taking. Instead of general to specific, you write specific notes first to get the general scope of the field. This means that you will have plenty of interconnected notes linked to broad or distinct topics. By opening Obsidians’ **backlinks** or **Graph Analysis**, you can instantly see the connections you’ve researched beforehand, delivered right at your doorstep, through any context you’re looking for. 

> Example of Graph Analysis’ Co-citations giving me all the information I need on Accountability, both direct and second-order relational links.

## Using the Zettelkasten in producing high quality content
This cuts down your need for research, along with the boredom attributed to writing something you don't want as it follows your interests and it thinks for you. The only thing you need to do is connect.

1. **Develop topics:** As you make new notes, themes will start to develop around your areas of interest. You can interact with your notes to follow the links, and you’ll see holes in your knowledge to guide your learning
2. **Getting research/writing ideas**: You’ll never have to wonder again what you’d like to read about or write about. It will be clear from where there are lots of notes clustered around a topic in your slip box. For example, you may have many notes with a certain tag, or if you use a piece of software such as Obsidian you can visualize which notes link to one another to see patterns in your thinking.
3. **Turn your notes into writing**: You can collect your notes together, and quickly form rough drafts for articles or books. Don’t simply copy your notes, though. Rewrite them, stitching them together along the way to create a completed piece.

##### The Zettelkasten allows you to work on multiple different projects at the same time
The Zettelkasten's real strength is that you can work on multiple projects at the same time. By merely following your interests, you can create tremendous progress. If you’re bored on one project, you can leave it for a bit and return later when you need it. You can work on several projects at once because abandoning one project doesn’t mean deleting it, it will still have value by merely existing in the system—plus, and you can always work on it again since it won’t go anywhere. So, you can follow your curiosities and interests wherever they land. Luhmann said that he only does things that he wants, only those that he wants.
