#  On Habits and Habit-Building 

Habits are powerful. A habit can be as small as doing five pushups everyday, but, eventually, it’ll compound into monumental changes. Save 10₱ a day and it’ll become 3650₱ by the end of the year. It is a very powerful concept. The habit can either be positive or negative; eitherway, they compound, altering your entire life, whether you’re aware of it or not. 

To live the life you wish to live, you must learn how to utilize this fact to your advantage, how to use the compounding effect to aid you in your endeavors and become who you want to be.

However, utilizing the compounding effect requires consistency and the certainty that your habits will stick. And so, I made this paper to guide you on how to achieve that consistency and how to build those habits. 

After all, the ability to build habits whenever you want is an essential skill that could change your entire life forever. 

# How to Build Habits
___
Firstly, let’s look at a **very important concept** in this whole paper, the Habit Feedback Loop: Reminder/Cue/Trigger ⇒ Routine/Action ⇒ Reward ⇒ Reminder/Cue/Trigger.

![](https://i.imgur.com/0vmUsiJ.png)

This is a very, very important concept. It means that habits are merely routines driven by repeated and rewarded triggers. By changing the trigger, one could also change the subsequent behavior. In this way, you can trick your brain into adopting a habit by finding the right sets of triggers you can attach to it. For bad habits like distractions, you can remove the trigger or the reward. Thus, mastering the ability to manipulate this loop is the key to habit formation. 

For now, let’s focus on the most important element, **the trigger**. 

**There are five primary ways your habits can be triggered**: *either by time, location, a preceding event, an emotional state, or by certain people*. Remember this and remember it well. If you identify these triggers in relation to your habits, it will give you a way to make it stick or to break it.

Note also that when choosing a habit trigger, it should be both **actionable and very specific**. 

Now, let’s move on to how we could use this practically.

### Implementation Intentions: Listing the triggers
An implementation intention sweeps away foggy notions like “I want to work out more” or “I want to be more productive” and transforms them into a concrete plan of action. Essentially, an Implementation Intention just means <u><b>listing the cues and triggers</b></u> that can be attached to your habits. At the bottom of the paper, there’s a table that let’s you do that. I recommend you write the triggers there and review them when needed,

Setting specific intentions can double or triple your odds of success, especially if reviewed. They need not be precise, just specific enough for a person to recall when given the right situational cues: either by time, location, a preceding event, an emotional state, or by certain people. 

So, those are the basics: identifying the habit triggers and listing each specifically. Simple, no? 

With the basics out of the way, the following sections will show the various habit triggers you could use. *But*, you don’t need to use all of them, adjust the triggers based on what you can and cannot do. At the same time, I encourage using as many cues as possible as it makes it more probable that you’ll follow through. So, I suggest experimenting with the triggers and your circumstances to figure out which works best.

#### Time and Location Triggers
**Time and location is one of the most prevalent cues in habit formation**. Be very consistent with the time and location when you perform your habit. If you do the action only when you feel like it, it will be difficult to get it to stick. So, a fixed time and location cue provides a glue for your habits.

> “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]"

#### Preceding Event Triggers (Habit Stacking)
**It's stacking your desired habit with habits you already do each day**. Here, an already established habit becomes a *cue* for the new habit. If you want, you can stack a lot of habits like Lego blocks, each triggering the next, though make sure it has enough of a foundation to stand on.

> “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]"

#### Emotion-based Triggers
**Find a strong positive emotion to attach to that habit**. <u>Positive reinforcements make habits stick</u>. However, the reward should be <u>immediate</u>, as dopamine releases fast. You don’t wait for night before you can reward yourself. It doesn’t work like that. Immediacy after the behavior is key, as well as the strength of the reward. Do something you enjoy <u>immediately</u> before a difficult habit.

>  “After I [HABIT I NEED], I get to [IMMEDIATE HABIT THAT INDUCE POSITIVE EMOTIONS]”

#### Temptation Bundling 
Temptation bundling works by **linking an action you want to do with an action you need do**. You’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time.

> “When I [HABIT I NEED TO DO], I will [HABIT I WANT TO DO] at the same time“
> “I will only [HABIT I WANT TO DO], when I [HABIT I NEED TO DO]”

#### Identity-Based Habit Cues
With an identity-based approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become, not what we want to achieve. Who is the type of person you want to become? What is one habit that casts a small vote for becoming that type of person? 

Focusing on outcomes, thinking it will change your identity, will just make you feel bad about yourself when you fail. But, **focusing on who you want to be drives you to work towards that identity**, reinforcing it until you achieve you desired outcome. 

We evolved to stay as consistent as possible to our self-image. An identity you choose will therefore give you actions consistent to it. This is the foundation of this cue. 

> I’m the type of person who: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Your identity emerges from your habits. Every affirmation confirms that identity as our own. Your values and principles will drive it rather than your desire for a result.

So, decide who you want to become and prove it to yourself with small wins. And ask yourself, "Does this action help me become the person I wish to be?"

Also, Identity cues should be definitive. “Sorry I’m trying to quit smoking” is not as stable as an identity as “Sorry, I don’t smoke.”

#### Social-based Habit Triggers and Accountability Systems
**Stick to people with good habits** and not bad ones. Find someone that can keep you accountable. We are social creatures and we have a habit of mirroring and not disappointing our peers.

The **Accountability System** is one of the strongest habit-tools of all time. This is where you create habit contracts with people where they can keep you accountable. In turn, you could also do the same to them, making it so that both parties reinforce the other. The punishment of broken habits can be painful and that’s good for getting it to stick. The best part about this though is that the camaraderie you feel is also its own reward. 

#### Figure out the Downscaled Version of your habit (Minimum Viable Action)
Procrastination is due to one’s perception of the friction and difficulty of a task. To counter this, you should commit to the **smallest possible action** to get the momentum going. This will help you run habits when you need to.

If you can't do a task, <u>convince yourself to only do a portion of it for an X number of minutes or X lower effort</u>. Then, keep reducing it until you find yourself able to do the task. As procrastination is the failure to start, this might give you the push to do so. And you might even feel like continuing as broken tasks annoy us. So, note the minimum possible effort you should expend, so you know what to do on “off days” when you can’t get yourself to act.

<u><b>Remember</b></u>: while achieving less is unpleasant, it’s not as bad as not achieving anything at all. A smaller action done daily compounds, better than just trying to maximize your routine and giving up when you can’t perfect it.

> The Minimum Possible Effort of My Habit: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

###### The Kaizen Method of Habit Formation 
Minimum Viable Actions are the core of psychology’s Kaizen, the process of forming a habit using small steps. here, you **ask yourself, “What’s the smallest step I can take?”** and take that step. Because the smallest step eventually leads to bigger changes.

Remember to <u>allocate time</u> though rather than just doing it when you feel like it. And, most importantly, if you miss a habit, at least do the minimum possible action or step, so that it doesn’t break the behavioral momentum you built. Momentum is the key word here—do not let it break.  

If you read a book and you can’t get yourself to read a chapter a day, content yourself with reading a small section consistently, It reduces friction and keeps the momentum. This is fine. This will compound to monumental changes. What makes this important though is that the small section you read will kickstart the habit formation process. So, even if you didn’t read a chapter, you’re still developing the habit of “Reading.”

That one small action eventually lets you read more than one section because the act of reading will become a habit, an automatic action you do regularly. By then, it will no longer be a chore to read more than a section because your body and mind will be hooked on specific triggers and cues forged by reading small sections consistently. 

Think small, and it will grow big. One small win can kickstart a habit or reinforce your identity and capabilities. So, celebrate those small wins. The smallest step eventually leads to bigger changes.

# Techniques for Habit Building
### Habit Trackers 
A simple way to measure whether you did a habit. The most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you stick with your routine.

Whether online or offline is your choice. Whatever is easier to access, do that. Search on the internet for various habit trackers, there’s a lot of them, and pick your poison. 

<u>Here’s a bunch of ones I’ve personally used.</u>
1. [Establish 6 Core Habits 💪 Habits Tracker 2022](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lruyAb3PK9YQ1Z1RXQfgCLqdZh8Rn2ugq12dN75wU6c/copy) – Pretty complete. This has all the days in the year in it and you can input as many habits as you need, with a percentage tracker tracking their progress.
2. [7 Best Google Sheets Calendar Templates](https://techwiser.com/best-google-sheets-calendar-templates/) – Sometimes, if I use calendars and mark them. This makes it easier for workouts since I need to mark how extensive my life is, as well as my rest days.
3. [Atomic Habits HabitTracker](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/Atomic+Habits/Habit+Tracker.pdf) – This is the habit-tracker of James Clear, the author of Atomic Habits.
4. [Loop Habit Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en&gl=US) – A habit tracking app I recommend.

### Reduce Exposure to Distracting Cues
We get Distracted because of the bad cues in our environment. If you want to be productive, then start removing those bad cues. Install site-blockers, block your phones and messages from distracting you and make it known to not disturb you. This will allow you to focus on what you need.

1. Acknowledge you’re getting distracted 
2. Identify those distractions
3. Remove it

Note: 20 second rule. If you make those habits inaccessible for 20 seconds, you are likely to give up on doing it. For example: Setting a password that takes 20 seconds. 

Generally, delaying a bad habit for later is effective. 

### Rules for Creating Good habits
- **Make It Obvious**. 
	- Implementation Intentions and making certain cues visible and obvious is key here.
- **Make it Attractive**
	- Tactics like Temptation Bundling and Reward-Systems, as well as joining groups that reinforces that habit is effective here.
- **Make it Easy**
	- Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits  and optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact when the moment of temptation comes. 
- **Make it Satisfying**
	- Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete a habit. You can also Sync your habits with something you already like (temptation bundling).

### Rules for Breaking Bad Habits
- **Make it invisible**. Reduce exposure. Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment.
	- Do you spend too much time on your phone? Remove it from your sight when you’re working or remove the apps that keep distracting you.
- **Make it unattractive**. Reframe your mind-set. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits.”
	- Want to no longer eat excessively? Highlight the consequences. This is better with an accountability partner or a habit tracker that tracks your successes and failures.
- **Make it difficult**. Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits (make it take longer than 20 seconds). Restrict your future choices to the ones that benefit you.
	- Want to spend less time on social media? Get an app-blocker like Offtime which only allows you to access a specific site if you wait for a minute. 
- **Make it unsatisfying**. Get an accountability partner. Ask someone to watch your behavior. Make the costs of your bad habits public and painful.
	- Bad habit you literally cannot stop? Get an accountability partner that that punishes you for partaking in the habit. 
- **Interference technique**. It is commonly suggested to use a replacement behavior before you could engage in a bad habit. However, neurological studies suggest that you can also do that AFTER you did a bad habit. It takes advantage of the fact that the same neurons responsible were active a moment ago, which means you can disrupt it. So, **upon executing a bad habit, we should being our awareness to the period after, and *immediately* execute a replacement habit**. 
	- For example, if you find yourself scrolling social media, close it, then immediately open a book, the replacement habit.

### Systems not Goals
Goals are what you want to achieve; systems are the processes you put in place to achieve them. Goals tell you where to go; systems tell you what you need to do to get there. Designing good systems go a long way. Systems are **powerful** because eventually they’ll fade into the background and become the new normal, an effortless way to achieve goals. 

**Willpower is unreliable, so use systems**. The best productivity systems are those that doesn’t allow you to think. It should make actions unconscious with hardly any willpower expended. It should build momentum all throughout. This is the role of implementation intentions and the several techniques outlined in this paper. These are systems, systems that can override the weakness of willpower. Through it, we can achieve more; through it, is consistency. 

# The Habit-Building Table
It is vital to understand each techniques above first (perhaps even the principles) before you can fill the blanks here. The table below acts as an Implementation Intention where you list the essential triggers or cues for your desired habit. It also allows you can diagnose your habits and unravel why it’s not working, as well as finding a way to make it stick. For breaking bad habits, you can use it to identify cues you can remove. Know, however, that while I encourage using as many triggers as possible, **you don’t need to fill up everything**, adjust it based on what what’s available to you. Feel free to mix, match, and experiment until you get it to stick.
