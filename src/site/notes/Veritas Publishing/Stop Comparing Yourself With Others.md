Our brain is primed to compare ourselves to others. We often compare up (someone better than us) to mimic what we can do better or down (someone below us) to cope when feeling bad about yourself. This can go out of hand. Upward comparisons destroy motivation. Downward comparisons is a vicious cycle and habit that make your situation worse. 

How can we stop this? 
### Know That Our brain compares relatively
Our brain compares us strangely. We don’t compare ourselves to elephants or ants and definitely not human beings like the president. The mind tries to put us in people it perceives to be in our league like people in the same grade or family. <u>Comparisons tend to be something related to us</u>. This becomes unfair as we compare ourselves not to their real life but to the life that they show us and to the life we perceive, which is often crafted for social reasons. 

Comparisons are also not one to one. It’s not complete in some way. Also, you don’t compare all our your attributes to all of their attributes, you compare the best of attribute of <u>five different people</u> with yourself, which is not fair.

If you want to stop comparisons, hone in on that unfairness and irrationality. You can also focus on the negative emotional state, as comparison is often a coping mechanism, and process that emotion. 

### You’re comparing different builds
In video games, different players have different "builds". For example, one player may focus on building a strong defense while another may focus on building a powerful offense. These different builds may work well for the individual player, but may not necessarily be the best option for another player. In life, it’s also the same. Your strengths and weaknesses are so different from other players that comparison is literally both unfair and meaningless. So, stop comparing. Don’t compare a knight to an archer. Don’t compare yourself to others. 

### When you start comparing
Seeing that our brain compares relatively, whenever you start comparing, ask yourself: **Why did my brain choose this person to compare? What is it that makes my brain think this is a fair comparison?**

You’ll discover that it’s not a fair comparison and that it’s not complete. Hone in on that. Recognize the strangeness of the attributes you compare to yourself and the negative emotions fueling it.

Accept and forgive each and every aspect of your present self, wherever you are. This means accepting that you can’t do anything about anything that has happened before. If you’re undeveloped in adulthood because of your childhood or if you’ve made a bad decision that is still haunting you, accept that there is nothing you can do. You can beat yourself up for it, think over what-ifs, blame your past self for not doing whatever, or you can do the helpful, healthy thing and just accept it. Reality is the present, not the past or the future. Think about what you can do instead. 

### You didn’t know any better
Recognize that it’s not your present self’s fault for the circumstances you find yourself in. After all, the you of today is not the same as the you years ago when you made those mistakes. When you think about it, those are completely different people! How can you blame your past self? He didn’t know any better. Poor kid must be so confused and unguided. How can you expect him to understand what he understands now? It’s foolish to blame him, you have better uses of your time. 

What we must do is accept the present circumstance and that we can’t do much to change the past. Accept that you did what you did, that you didn’t know any better. This is self-compassion. Mistakes are [[Determinism\|deterministic]], caused by past events, and part of everyday life. What matters is the present and what you can do now. 

### Play the present game with base stats
It’s like in a video game where you have base stats. You don’t whine at the character backstory for making this so, you just play the game with these stats and limitations. Everything is just circumstances and limitations in the present, there’s nothing to blame, it is the way it is. All you need to do is find what you can do to change it. 

**FOSTER AN EGO-LESS INTELLECT**. When disadvantages is separated from ego, it becomes problems to solve instead of reasons to quit. They become the order of operations to get control of your life.

### Accepting Who You Are
As a society, we assume that some things are objectively better than others. Theoretically, it seems true—but say you’re playing poker. Generally, an Ace is better than a Ten. In theory, that’s true, but if you have the option for a flush draw, then you don’t want an Ace, you want whatever suit you have. Your strategy to win that game changes. You can beat someone who’s got an ace, an “objectively” better card. When people rank things in a linear scale, we think about better and worse. But that’s not entirely true. How we win depends not on the cards others have, but how we make use of what we have. 

Your personality can be what it is. The most important thing is to play by your strength. There’s no right or wrong personality, you just need to understand what your personality is and how you’re gonna be good at it. Think about how much of an aspect of your personality do you need to exert and how can you play to your strengths. 

“The work place is structured to extroverts,” is something introverts complain about but it literally doesn’t matter. Understand your personality’s strengths and weaknesses and play by those strengths and weaknesses. If you’ve got a flush draw, go for a flush. Just because have pocket aces, doesn’t mean you should even try, but you could still win.

Also, accepting yourself has nothing to do with not changing. That’s a belief conditioned by society. The “If you don’t accept me at my worst” bullshit. What we should do is accept and forgive everything about ourselves, our mistakes, our circumstances, and our past, while also being willing to change for the better. To fix a program with bugs, you must first acknowledge it has bugs, then you improve it. 

### Acceptance and Actions
You can’t get over the disgust you feel towards yourself. The desire to get over that self-disgust comes from the disgust itself. “How do I change who I am” is a question only asked by people disgusted with themselves. Even as you try to improve, you’re reinforcing the disgust. Do not feed this. The only way to feel better about yourself is not to get over it (I am bad, so I need to be good), not to overcome it, but to <u>accept</u> all the parts about yourself—then choose to act differently on a day to day basis. 

Instead of feeling disgusted about yourself, accept your mistakes. This is what acceptance look like:

> “Yeah, so I’ve made a lot of mistakes. I realize that I may have screwed over a lot of things in my life, and I’m not really sure if I’m a good or bad person, and that’s okay—because I’m working on it. I may have screwed up a lot of things, but today, I can do better. I have no idea in the cosmic sense if I’m this or that, I certainly can’t judge that about myself. **But, so be it**. This is my journey. I’m not perfect and I’m probably a bad person. But today, I can try to do differently and act differently. I can change what I do in a day to day basis, even if I’m this or that. So be it. Would it be better if things were different? Sure, but it is what it is. But so, be it.“

Acceptance doesn’t mean giving up. It means accepting where you are and wanting to move forward. It doesn’t stop forward momentum, it fuels it. 

Change begins in accepting oneself. Admitting who you are creates opportunities to be better. Don’t beat yourself up for it, accept it and **OWN it**. That’s how you get enough resilience to change. “I failed the test. Welp, I need to study harder.”
