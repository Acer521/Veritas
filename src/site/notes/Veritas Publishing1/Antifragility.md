> Antifragility is a property that benefits from shocks, discord, chaos, and black swans. Your muscles are antifragile as it strengthens through damage. It’s an interesting concept, useful in evaluating and creating systems. It can also be used in many areas, from personal to businesses to economics. It’s that one rare thing that benefits from the negative, and it ought to be desired. For antifragile things, damage and stress are information to be used to improve the system
## Fragile, Robust, Antifragile
People used to think that the opposite of fragile is robust, but robust just means sturdy. If the fragile is easily broken by shocks and disorder, then its opposite should benefit from it. This concept is called antifragility, a property that benefits from chaos.

Think about it like this: Fragility is like a candle, easily extinguished by the slightest breeze. Robustness is like a lamp, able to withstand strong winds. But Antifragility is like a bushfire—it gets stronger from the wind, from disorder, from chaos.  

Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.

- The Hydra is antifragile. The more heads you cut, the stronger it becomes.
- Post traumatic growth
- The Streisand effect benefits a product because of criticism and controversy, like books.
- Grit is using pain to be better and more persistent.
- Those who seem outrageous have antifragile reputations than those who seem too proper.
- The mind and body is antifragile, improving from damage: The Human Body and the Human Mind. 
- Antibiotics. Every time you take an antibiotic, you help, to some degree, the mutation of germs into antibiotic-resistant strains.

## Some Discussion
**Measuring Fragility**
- We may not predict when something breaks, but we can predict what breaks before it. This is how you measure fragility. Lindy Effect for example
- Fragility can measure by acceleration of harm. If I smash my car at 50mph, I’d be more affected, than I would if I smashed it for 50 times with only 1mph.
- A good way to reduce damage in a system is to decentralize. Problems still exist, but instead of dealing with large life-ending problems in one system, you deal with small ones in multiple systems. They get dispersed, lessening the possibilities of black swans.
**Denial of Antifragility**
- Denial of antifragility is dangerous. Many things benefit from damage and regresses in idleness. sticking too much in the comfort zone is dangerous, abilities deteriorate, as well as muscles and mind if not given the appropriate stressors it needs.
