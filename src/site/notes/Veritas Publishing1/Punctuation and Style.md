> Punctuation is not just important because of grammar, but because of the numerous stylistic possibilities you can do with them. They make writing sound precise, economical, and beautiful, without even employing rhetorical devices.

### Basics of Pauses and Emphasis
- **When you pause, it creates emphasis**. In writing, this is indicated through punctuation. Specifically, periods, dashes, ellipses, and colons.
	- **Sentence Fragment**: “You need to quit procrastinating, so sit down and write your first draft. Now.”
	- **Periods in short parallel sentences to create rhythm**: “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.”
	- **Use dashes to mark abrupt changes** in thought or the flow of a sentence—or, put more simply, use dashes for dashing effect.
	- **Use ellipses** to **mark omitted text** in a direct quote and to **indicate a trailing off of thought or a troubled pause**, as in “I … I just don’t know.” 
	- **A colon to introduce something**, as I do here: to introduce what follows.

### Dashes
- A dash is a mark of separation stronger than a comma, less formal than a colon, and more relaxed than the parentheses.
- **Dashes grab attention with its pauses and showiness**
	- Commas <u>designate asides and modifiers</u>, but with only a slight slight interruption. Dashes creates attention-grabbing pauses.
	- Colons <u>introduce</u> without showiness; the dash is more brash..
	- Parenthesis <u>encloses information</u> of less importance, the dash emphasizes.
	- Parenthesis and dashes are good visual markers <u>when enclosing material with many internal commas</u>. 

### Commas
- Few or no commas aren’t the problem; few or no commas are a symptom of the problem. It might mean that your writing is monotonous. 
- **Using Commas to Create Subordinate Clauses**
	- This makes writing less monotonous and more rhythmic. 
	- Through this, you can switch the focus. Highlight the important or needed.
	- You can shift the emphasis from the subordinate clause to the main clause by starting with the words, “Because, Although, When, etc.”
	- **Trailing Element**": Phrase or clause that elaborates or comments on the statement in the main clause—like the clause after the dash in this sentence. It creates variety in the structure. 

### Ellipses 
- **Mainly, ellipses are for**: (1) omitted text in a direct quotation, as in “The Hauser report recommends … three changes”; (2) a thoughtful pause, as in “Well … you get the idea”; and (3) a trailing off of thought, as in “If only I could remember my next point …”
- **Ellipses are good at compressing sentences to make it stronger**. Aside from the three dots, it also means “**to omit**.” It can be used the conclude a sentence neatly and snappily.
	- “Sometime they’ll give a war and nobody will come [to fight it],”

### Semi-colons
- Links two independent clauses but **suggests a connection**.
- **Adds clarity** when items are long or have internal commas.
- **It creates a pause** shorter than a period but longer than a comma.
- **It adds subtlety**. (Understanding a concept is one thing, but applying it is another → Understanding a concept is one thing; applying it is another.)

### Periods and Sentence Fragments
- Fragments can **punctate a point** or **advance a plot** with precision and brevity.
- They can **set a fast pace**. They move thought quickly. And efficiently.
- **For stylistic effect**: Their clipped, staccato cadence **varies the rhythm** from the flow of complete sentences. **They add pauses, contrast, and energy**. 
- They can be one sentence paragraphs. They can follow a complete sentence. Like an afterthought. They can be placed before a colon to introduce a complete sentence. (The effect: They draw attention to what follows.) They can be introduced by colons: like this. Or by dashes—like that.
- The clipped efficiency of the fragments, built on spare language and drawing on a few well-chosen, poignant details, **leaves something for the reader’s imagination**. The **fragments imply or suggest**, rather than complete and make explicit.

### Rhetorical Schemes 
**Parallel Structure**
- Nonparallel sentences are awkward. Parallel sentences are pleasing and distinct. It creates balance through repetition of similar elements. 
- *“To err is human, forgiving is divine” → “To err is human, to forgive divine*”
- *“What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure”*

**1-2 Combination**
- **The first sentence makes a statement; the second sentence undercuts it**. 
- It’s the ironic twist that surprises the reader and makes the quip memorable.
	- *“Writing is easy. All you have to do is cross out the wrong words.*”
	- *“You can’t wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club.*”
- But, other times, it’s more subtle: *“It is splendid to be a great writer, to put men into the frying pan of your words and make them pop like chestnuts,*”

**Long-Short Combo**
- Follow a long, complicated sentence with a short, snappy one. This creates emphasis and energy.
- The longer the first sentence and he shorter the second, the better. It contrasts like a joke.
- *“I have felt the pull of history and place in a hundred places around the globe, and I don’t doubt I could have lived a happy life in any one of them. But chance put me here.*”

**Create a rhythm, then break it**
- A good beat, patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables, can be great, but too much can be monotonous. We want some variation. So, first, you establish a rhythm; then you break the pattern.
	- “I take thee to be my wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us depart.”
	- After the first “to … to … to …” comes “for … for … for … for …” and then he changes it to “in … in …” and then he goes back to “to … to …” Then comes the shorter, almost abrupt, “till death us depart” 

**Subordinate Clause**
- This makes writing less monotonous and more rhythmic. 
- Through this, you can switch the focus and highlight the important or needed.
- You can shift the emphasis from the subordinate clause to the main clause by starting with the words, “Because, Although, When, etc.”
- **Trailing Element**": Phrase or clause that elaborates or comments on the statement in the main clause—like the clause after the dash in this sentence. It creates variety in the structure. It should be independent though.
**Periodic Sentence**
- **The main clause follows the parallel elements**: *“Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she had to walk into mine.*”
- The dramatic delay creates suspense and emphasis before the reveal of the main clause. 
**Loose Sentence**
- **The main clause is followed by a series of parallel elements**: *“She peered into the dark room, fearing for her life, listening for the slightest sound, wondering if the murderer lurked within.*”
- More relaxed than periodic. It caps off a series, a grace note after the downbeat. 

> [!important] Rhetorical Schemes
> ### <u>Schemes</u>
> **There are four basic types of schemes**: <u>schemes of balance</u> (such as antithesis and parallelism), <u>schemes of inversion or unusual word order</u> (as in “Ask not …” and Yoda’s speech patterns), <u>schemes of omission</u> (such as ellipses), and <u>schemes of repetition</u> (such as antimetabole and chiasmus).
> 
> Repetition gives it more emphasis; Parallel statements enhances it. 
> 
> **Parallel Structure**
> - Nonparallel sentences are awkward. Parallel sentences are pleasing and distinct. It creates balance through repetition of similar elements. 
> - *“To err is human, forgiving is divine” → “To err is human, to forgive divine*”
> - *“What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure*”
> 
> **Antithesis**
> - First half is the premise; second half is the contrary statement. (*“Not that the story need be long, but it will take a long while to make it short*”) 
> - Repetition gives it more emphasis. (*the sky wasn’t blue; the sky was green*.)
> - Parallel statements give enhances it. (*the sky was…; the sky wasn’t*…) 
> 
> **Chiasmus**
> - The <u>repetition of grammatical structures</u> without repetition of the same words or phrases. (*It’s hard to make time, but to waste it is easy*.) `(A/B; B/A.)`
> 	- “It’s hard (A) to make time (I), but to waste it (I) is easy (A).”
> 
> **Antimetabole**
> - The <u>repetition of words</u> in reverse order. (*Everyone who loves his country is a patriot, but not every patriot loves his country*.) `(A/B; B/A.)`
> - *“Ask not what your country (A) can do for you (B); ask what you (B) can do for your country (A).*”
> 
> **Anadiplosis** (Subcategory of Antimetabole)
> - Repeating the last word of the last sentence at the beginning of the next sentence. 
> - *”Hard work leads to success; success leads to happiness”* `A→B; B→C`
> - “If you can’t be with the one you love, love the one you’re with”
> 
> **Anaphora**
> - Repetition of the first lines in succession. (Give me liberty, or give me death)
> - Repetition of the beginnings in succession emphasizes the emotion and drama. 
> 	- “*It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to heaven, we were all going direct the other way*”
> 	- In fact, you can even sneak in an agenda there and it wouldn’t be noticed because of the rhetoric. Just like what Winston Churchill did. `A/B; A/C`
> **Epistrophe**
> - Repetition of the closing lines in succession. (*When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child*.) `B/A; C;A`
> 
> **Isocolon**
> - Repetition of the same grammatical structure with the same number of syllables. 
> - “How to succeed at business: Have a vision, know your values, and work like crazy,”
> - “Many are called, but few are chosen.”
> 
> <u>Tropes</u>
> - **Metaphors, Similes, Analogies**
> 	- For similes, move from the [[Concrete-Abstract Spectrum in Writing\|literal to the figurative]], from realistic description to imaginative. 
> 		- “It was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer’s day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men’s stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o’clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.”
> 	- The best metaphors reinforces or clarifies without calling undue attention to themselves. They are not contrived or overdone. Good metaphors are: simple, apt, and novel.
> 	- Return to your metaphors or similes to create cohesion, coherence, and payoff. 
> 	- Don’t overthink, try to write clever analogies, then decide later which to use. 
> 
> <u>Writing and Imagination</u>
> - Do not inhibit yourself. Try to list different metaphors, different objects to focus on, different descriptions, different styles, then decide later. Be as ridiculous as possible.
