# Welcome to Veritas
My name is Kristoffer and there are two things I love most in this world: reading and notetaking. I loved them for years since I was just a little child. That passion eventually led to boxes of notes and read books—which led to an Obsidian repository, which led to its publishing in this very website. A collection of notes from all kinds of fields, ranging from political science, psychology, learning theory, education, sociology, law, philosophy, theology, history, and many more, particularly from fields of practical application and wisdom. I’ve taken notes for myself for all these years and I have benefitted from them in ways you could not imagine. It’s not an exaggeration to say that I owe my life to these notes. So, just as they helped me, I wish it would also help you. Welcome to Veritas. Happy reading.

> [!info]+ Quick Notice
> Publishing would not be as fast as I would’ve liked. I can publish all of my notes, a combined total of three million words, but I found that absolutely unreadable when I did that in Github. As such, I shall try my utmost to rewrite each note, while retaining what I find important in each of them, so that you dear readers can read them with ease. Thank you for understanding.
